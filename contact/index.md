Instructor's instructions: 
The class project deliverable should be a system documentation of your prototype and usability inspection. 

1.Conceptual Model
•System scope
•System goals

2.The Users of the System
•Definition of the target audience
•Summary data on characteristics of the target audience:
•Two or more personas

3.The Task Being Supported by the System
•Task description which could be any or a combination of the following:-Hierarchical task analysis-GOMS model
•A set of user cases/essential use cases and scenarios-a complete set or used in conjunction with other documentation tools (e.g., journey maps)
•Description of additional salient job/task characteristics-Frequency/time-Environment/context-Complexity/difficulty

4.Interface Design Decisions
•Major design decisions and the rationale for each of the most important decisions•Basis for rationale may include:-Informal user studies-Research results reported in the literature

5.Interface Design Description
•State transition diagram
•Or other graphical illustration of the system architecture
•One copy of your prototype saved as .pdf

6.Usability Inspection
•To ask at least two classmates outside of your group to evaluate your prototype
•The designers need to explain the following to the evaluators
-The goal of the system
-The scope of the user group
-The task to be supported
The evaluators need to understand the scope of the prototype and identify five strengths/weaknesses of your prototype design.
